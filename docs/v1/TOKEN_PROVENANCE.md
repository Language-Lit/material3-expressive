# v1 token provenance

Access date: 2026-07-19

The default token set is a web adaptation of current first-party Material data.
Every source is pinned to a repository revision so regeneration does not drift
when an upstream `latest` directory changes.

The current Material Web color files take precedence for this web library where
platform generations differ. In particular, the current light scheme uses tone
30 for `onPrimaryContainer`, `onSecondaryContainer`, and
`onTertiaryContainer`; older Android-generated schemes use tone 10.

Material's generated font sizes and line heights are converted from pixels to
`rem` using the browser's 16px default. The reference families retain Roboto
first and add the generic `sans-serif` fallback required for a resilient web
font stack. Variable-font axes remain typed metadata for capable consumers.

The current AndroidX `Typography` API was rechecked for T05 on 2026-07-19. It
exposes emphasized counterparts for all 15 baseline display, headline, title,
body, and label roles. `Text` consumes both complete scales and maps all nine
modeled axes to CSS `font-variation-settings`; it does not approximate the
Expressive scale with an application-defined bold style.

## AndroidX Material 3

Primary revision: `0be207d91046b7376beeef5544d331a02d6fa87c`

- Motion API and slot meanings: [MotionScheme.kt](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/0be207d91046b7376beeef5544d331a02d6fa87c/compose/material3/material3/src/commonMain/kotlin/androidx/compose/material3/MotionScheme.kt)
- Expressive spring values: [ExpressiveMotionTokens.kt](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/0be207d91046b7376beeef5544d331a02d6fa87c/compose/material3/material3/src/commonMain/kotlin/androidx/compose/material3/tokens/ExpressiveMotionTokens.kt)
- Standard spring values: [StandardMotionTokens.kt](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/0be207d91046b7376beeef5544d331a02d6fa87c/compose/material3/material3/src/commonMain/kotlin/androidx/compose/material3/tokens/StandardMotionTokens.kt)
- Tonal elevation behavior: [ColorScheme.kt](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/0be207d91046b7376beeef5544d331a02d6fa87c/compose/material3/material3/src/commonMain/kotlin/androidx/compose/material3/ColorScheme.kt)

Motion is represented by the same standard/expressive, fast/default/slow, and
spatial/effects slots as AndroidX. T02 initially preserved only spring
parameters. T07 adds the first required web motion adapter at token serialization:
every spring deterministically emits a unit-mass settlement duration at a 0.001
threshold and a ten-sample CSS `linear()` curve. The source damping ratio and
stiffness remain canonical, and custom themes regenerate scoped derived values.
ADR 0007 records this projection; it adds no browser or React dependency to the
token layer.

Tonal surface-container roles are the preferred web elevation colors. The
AndroidX tonal overlay formula remains represented for custom schemes and later
theme services; it does not replace the sourced default surface-container roles.

## Web accessibility adaptations

- Required default text-role contrast is 4.5:1, following [WCAG 2.2 Success Criterion 1.4.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#contrast-minimum).
- Material's 48dp minimum interactive target is represented as 48 CSS pixels at
  the component-token boundary, following the [Material 3 minimum interactive component size API](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material3/package-summary#minimumInteractiveComponentSize()).

## Component tokens

The registry grows only as each component task reaches conformance. `Surface`
is the first registration and cites the pinned AndroidX `Surface.kt` revision.
Its defaults map the passive surface container, content color, rectangular
shape, and zero tonal/shadow elevations to existing system tokens. Explicit
Surface variants continue to resolve through system color, shape, and elevation
roles so custom themes remain authoritative.

`Text` deliberately adds no component-token registration. AndroidX Text reads a
selected theme `TextStyle` and inherited content color, so the web adaptation
maps directly to existing `sys.typography` and CSS color inheritance. Font
loading remains consumer-owned and is not token-generation behavior.

`Icon` registers its 24px default from current Android Compose icon guidance and
its Material Symbols web defaults from Google's current guide. The glyph adapter
models outlined, rounded, and sharp font-family hooks plus `FILL` 0, `wght` 400,
`GRAD` 0, `opsz` 24, and `ROND` 50. The current guide documents the adjustable
ranges and now includes `ROND` in its variable-font requests; T06 carries that
Expressive axis even though the guide's introductory copy still describes the
four original symbol axes. Font files, subsetting, and network delivery remain
consumer-owned. SVG sources consume only Icon size and inherited `currentColor`.

`Button` registers current AndroidX Material 3 revision
`dd849e200f5046c2f2ca904e821fc9d42cbd0256`. The five generated size token files
supply visual heights 32/40/56/96/136px, padding, icon metrics, outline widths,
and size-aware resting/pressed corner roles. Filled, filled-tonal, elevated,
outlined, and text generated tokens supply enabled/disabled color roles,
opacities, and elevation. The source Button implementation supplies the 58px
minimum width, label type selection, content-padding corrections, and its
intentional no-bounce default-effects shape spring. Round CSS radii are exact
half-heights so the sourced pill geometry interpolates rather than transitioning
from an arbitrary 9999px value. The web root consumes the existing 48px density
target independently from the visual height.

`IconButton` registers current AndroidX Material 3 revision
`f0793303999c933a40c10d79212e0580d21bdc68`. `IconButtonDefaults.kt`, the four
variant token files, and the five generated size token files supply standard,
filled, filled-tonal, and outlined action/toggle roles; heights
32/40/56/96/136px; narrow/uniform/wide widths; icons 20/24/24/32/40px;
outlines 1/1/1/2/3px; and round, square, pressed, and selected corner pairs.
The implementation source confirms a 48px target and intentionally selects
default-effects motion for corner morphs. Exact half-height CSS radii represent
`CornerFull`, allowing the selected round/square inversion to interpolate. The
web adaptation uses the recommended vibrant system roles where Compose also
offers inherited-local-content overloads, and uses `aria-pressed` for native
toggle-button semantics.

`FloatingActionButton` registers current AndroidX Material 3 revision
`b0ef6d36c141931a051272e39ad3f4783dcb28e0`. `FabBaselineTokens`,
`FabMediumTokens`, `FabLargeTokens`, their extended counterparts, and the
current implementations supply 56/80/96px containers; 24/28/36px icons;
16/20/28px corners; size-aware label type and spacing; primary-container color;
and Level 3/4 normal plus Level 1/2 lowered elevation. The 36px large icon and
12/16px medium/large icon-label gaps follow explicit source corrections while
the generated token files retain upstream TODO values. The paired toggle FAB
source supplies its 56px final container, 28px corner, 20px icon,
primary/on-primary selected colors, logical top-end alignment, and
fast-spatial progress. The web API keeps its native button name stable and uses
`aria-pressed` rather than importing menu semantics before T24.

`Card` registers current AndroidX Material 3 revision
`0be207d91046b7376beeef5544d331a02d6fa87c`. `Card.kt` plus generated
`FilledCardTokens` and `ElevatedCardTokens` v0_210 and `OutlinedCardTokens`
v0_192 supply the medium corner; surface-container-highest, surface-container-low,
and surface containers; on-surface content; outline-variant/on-surface borders;
disabled composition; and Levels 0/1/2 state elevations. The source also
contains dragged Levels 3/4/3, but T10 owns no drag operation and makes no
dragged-state claim. Current first-party Card has no separate Expressive size or
shape overload, so the web component preserves current geometry and consumes
the shared Expressive effects motion projection for interactive state changes.

`Checkbox` registers current AndroidX Material 3 branch revision
`225f50d42bf0adeb2abf4b6109befb5ab6ce4efc`, `Checkbox.kt` blob
`a8cb1c1edcbb50bcb4fe82dc2051b9656ee173a7`, and generated `CheckboxTokens` blob
`90342356e6b7aa7571f15fb895c29900db75749b` at `VERSION: 14_1_0`. They supply the
18px container, 2px corner, 2px outline and checkmark stroke, 40px state layer,
primary/on-primary checked roles, on-surface-variant unchecked outline, surface
disabled checkmark, and the 0.38 disabled opacities. The two opacity constants
`SelectedDisabledContainerOpacity` and `UnselectedDisabledContainerOpacity` are
equal but remain separate tokens because the source reads them under different
names. The three transparent roles are `Color.Transparent` literals upstream and
stay CSS `transparent` rather than becoming unthemed variables.

Geometry follows the token-backed path that the source selects when
`ComposeMaterial3Flags.isCheckboxStylingFixEnabled` is enabled; AndroidX still
ships that flag disabled, retaining a 20dp box inside 2dp padding under the open
`TODO(b/188529841)`. The checkmark coordinates are the sourced normalized
polyline and its `checkCenterGravitationShiftFraction` endpoints. Two roles are
deliberate web additions: the unchecked state layer uses the unselected outline
role because the sourced `indicatorColor` returns a transparent color that cannot
show hover, focus, or pressed feedback, and the focus ring uses the generated but
upstream-unread `FocusIndicatorColor` secondary role because visible focus is
required. The sourced springs need no substitution because Expressive default
spatial 0.8/380, default effects 1.0/1600, and fast effects 1.0/3800 already
match this library's scheme.

`Radio` registers the same AndroidX Material 3 branch revision
`225f50d42bf0adeb2abf4b6109befb5ab6ce4efc`, `RadioButton.kt` blob
`02bdd9c675137bb277e454b21ffec58fc4ff6dfb`, and generated `RadioButtonTokens`
blob `9c3d1a69f1dada4962d9f3f68a40a36f26824683` at `VERSION: v0_117`. They
supply the 20px container, 2px ring stroke, 10px drawn dot diameter, 40px
state layer, and primary/on-surface-variant selected/unselected roles. The
source paints the ring and dot from one shared `radioColor` value, so Radio
registers one icon-color role per state instead of separate ring/dot roles.
`DisabledSelectedIconOpacity` and `DisabledUnselectedIconOpacity` are both
0.38 but remain separate tokens because the source reads them under different
names, matching the Checkbox precedent for its own equal-but-distinct
opacities.

Two roles are deliberate web additions, both following Checkbox precedent:
the state layer uses the same-state icon-color role because the pinned
`ripple()` call carries no explicit per-state color, and the focus ring uses
the secondary role because `RadioButtonTokens` defines no focus-indicator
token at all. The sourced `MotionSchemeKeyTokens.FastSpatial` dot animation
and `DefaultEffects` color animation need no substitution for the same reason
as Checkbox's springs.

`Switch` registers the same AndroidX Material 3 branch revision
`225f50d42bf0adeb2abf4b6109befb5ab6ce4efc`, `Switch.kt` blob
`15dbb283ad8b99ca2aac1b665a02e2f3ebce6293`, and generated `SwitchTokens` blob
`e73c33330cdd86a2c0cfeec04d2cd12d4e01da64` at `VERSION: v0_210`. They supply
the 52×32px track, 2px outline, 16/24/28px unselected/selected/pressed handle
sizes, 40px state layer, 16px icon size, primary/on-primary/on-primary-container
selected roles, and surface-container-highest/outline/surface-container-highest
unselected roles. `SwitchTokens` also generates Hover/Focus/Pressed-suffixed
handle, track, and icon color roles that `SwitchColors`/`defaultSwitchColors`
never read, so they are not registered, matching the unread-role precedent
from Checkbox and Radio. `DisabledTrackOpacity` (0.12) is one source constant
read by three different disabled roles — the disabled checked track, the
disabled unchecked track, and the disabled unchecked border — and is
registered once and reused rather than duplicated, unlike Checkbox's
distinctly-named equal opacities. `DisabledSelectedHandleOpacity` is a real
constant equal to 1.0, a functional no-op kept as a literal opaque color.

Two roles are deliberate web additions, following the same Checkbox/Radio
precedent: the state layer uses a primary/on-surface-variant identity pairing
because the pinned `ripple()` call carries no explicit per-state color, and
disabled colors use `color-mix(..., transparent)` instead of the source's
`compositeOver(colorScheme.surface)`, so they composite correctly against
whatever backdrop the control actually sits on. The sourced
`MotionSchemeKeyTokens.FastSpatial` thumb-shape animation and `DefaultEffects`
color animation need no substitution for the same reason as Checkbox's and
Radio's springs; the press-triggered `SnapSpec` is reproduced as a
zero-duration `transition-duration` scoped to `:active`.

`TextField`/`TextArea` register the same AndroidX Material 3 branch
revision `225f50d42bf0adeb2abf4b6109befb5ab6ce4efc`, generated
`FilledTextFieldTokens` blob `431029bad8804cec683c3077744f8783ca0ced56` at
`VERSION: v0_210` and `OutlinedTextFieldTokens` blob
`13f1d6b644376e767ea30def343065ccc274f6ce` at `VERSION: v0_103`. Every
content color role — input, placeholder, label, leading icon, trailing
icon, and supporting text — is identical between the two token files, since
Kotlin has no shared-token-file mechanism and AndroidX simply repeats each
constant under both names; this registration keeps one unprefixed copy of
each instead of a duplicated pair, and registers the container fill/shape
and indicator/outline border per variant only where the source's values
genuinely differ (including the outlined border's own 0.12 disabled opacity
versus every other role's shared 0.38). Every `Hover*`-suffixed role in both
files is unread — `TextFieldColors`' accessors take only
`(enabled, isError, focused)`, with no fourth "hovered" axis anywhere in the
resolved color model — matching the unread-role precedent from Checkbox,
Radio, and Switch. `FilledTextFieldTokens.DisabledContainerColor`/
`DisabledContainerOpacity` are unread too:
`ColorScheme.defaultTextFieldColors()` resolves the filled container to the
same full-opacity `ContainerColor` in every state including disabled, so
this registration reproduces that actual behavior rather than the token
file's documented, unapplied dimmed value. `InputFont`/`LabelFont`/
`SupportingFont` and `LeadingIconSize`/`TrailingIconSize` are unread by name
for the same reason as Switch's geometry duplicates: typography is pulled
live from `MaterialTheme.typography.bodyLarge`/`.bodySmall`, so this port
references the theme's own baseline body-large/body-small typescale roles
directly in component CSS instead of re-registering them as component
tokens.

Unlike every prior selection control, disabled colors here are not a
deliberate web deviation: the pinned source itself resolves every disabled
text-field color as true alpha (`fromToken(...).copy(alpha = ...)`), not
`compositeOver(colorScheme.surface)`, so this registration's
`color-mix(..., transparent)` technique reproduces the pinned source's own
semantics exactly rather than correcting away from a baked-backdrop
assumption.

`SegmentedButtonGroup` registers the same AndroidX Material 3 branch
revision `225f50d42bf0adeb2abf4b6109befb5ab6ce4efc`, `SegmentedButton.kt`
blob `295bc3889b25193473d4e4670b98c1d33aaa2663`, and generated
`OutlinedSegmentedButtonTokens` blob `2530ef60381d2ab54edb097c1a35dcc97d6c391c`
at `VERSION: v0_162`. `defaultSegmentedButtonColors()` reads the identical
`OutlineColor` constant for both the active and inactive border, and the
identical `DisabledLabelTextColor`/`DisabledLabelTextOpacity` pair for both
the disabled active and disabled inactive content color — not two
distinctly-named constants that happen to match, the exact same call both
times — so each is registered once here instead of as an active/inactive
pair, matching the T14 content-color consolidation precedent. The disabled
active container reuses the enabled `SelectedContainerColor` undimmed and
the disabled inactive container reuses the same `Color.Transparent` literal
the enabled inactive container already expresses directly in the
stylesheet: the token file defines no disabled container role at all, so a
disabled selected segment keeps its full tonal fill and no disabled
container token exists. Every `Hover*`/`Focus*`/`Pressed*`-suffixed role,
and even the base `SelectedIconColor`/`UnselectedIconColor`/
`DisabledIconColor`/`DisabledIconOpacity` roles, are unread:
`SegmentedButtonContent` never tints its `Icon` explicitly, so the icon
always inherits the same `LocalContentColor` the label text resolves from
the label-text tokens above — extending the unread-role precedent from
every prior selection control to roles the source defines but never
connects to any color-resolution path at all. `LabelTextFont` is unread by
name for the same reason as TextField's typography roles: it is pulled live
from the theme's own `label-large` typescale role directly in component
CSS. The pinned source applies no `minimumInteractiveComponentSize`-
equivalent modifier to `SegmentedButton`, unlike Checkbox/Radio/Switch, so
this registration carries no `minimum-interactive-target` token at all —
the 40px `ContainerHeight` is the real, undilated interactive height.

`Dialog` registers the same AndroidX Material 3 branch revision
`225f50d42bf0adeb2abf4b6109befb5ab6ce4efc`, `DialogTokens.kt` blob
`ab467ec4329ecba62c406ad8355085abf20771a2` and `AlertDialog.kt` blob
`5448ca3a52fdf66709ff713b81ea7a4f3641e39e`, both at `VERSION: v0_210`. Every
`DialogTokens` color, shape, and elevation role that `AlertDialogContent`
actually reads is registered directly: `ContainerColor`, `ContainerShape`,
`ContainerElevation`, `IconColor`/`IconSize`, `HeadlineColor`,
`SupportingTextColor`, `ActionLabelTextColor`. `HeadlineFont`/
`SupportingTextFont`/`ActionLabelTextFont` are unread by name for the same
reason as every prior typography role in this library: they are pulled live
from the theme's own `headline-small`/`body-medium` typescale roles
directly in component CSS. `AlertDialogDefaults.dialogPadding`/`textPadding`
use the non-"precision pointer" branch (24px both), the same
provisional-Expressive exclusion basis already applied to every prior task
that hit a `shouldUsePrecisionPointerComponentSizing`-gated value.
`DialogMinWidth`/`DialogMaxWidth` (280dp/560dp, from `AlertDialog.kt`) are
registered as measured dimensions rather than `$ref`s, since they are not
theme-scoped system values in the source either. The pinned Compose source
defines no cross-platform Material3 scrim-opacity or viewport-margin value —
window dimming there is an Android platform default, and the 280/560px width
bounds have no accompanying viewport-margin or height-cap value of their
own — so both the 32% scrim opacity and the 24px viewport margin are
cross-validated against material-web's dialog CSS
(`github.com/material-components/material-web`, `dialog/internal/_dialog.scss`,
`.scrim { opacity: 32% }`, `max-width: min(560px, calc(100% - 48px))`)
instead — the same material-web source already cited above as this
project's foundation-token authority, here corroborating a component-level
value for the first time because the pinned Compose source has none of its
own for this role.

`Menu` registers the same AndroidX Material 3 branch revision
`225f50d42bf0adeb2abf4b6109befb5ab6ce4efc`, `MenuTokens.kt` blob
`512d25472ad549b911ca61641e1b5fa87eded5dc` at `VERSION: v0_210`,
`ListTokens.kt` blob `9c1823f65873878d6b3e746cf0393522c0b980c2` at
`VERSION: 29.0.0`, and `StandardMenuTokens.kt` blob
`d4743d36238e15a38dc27f710889b24dd9fb2951` at `VERSION: 24.1.2`. Container
color/shape/elevation come from `MenuTokens` (`ContainerColor`
surfaceContainer, `ContainerShape` cornerExtraSmall, `ContainerElevation`
level2). Plain item color comes from `ListTokens` (`ItemLabelTextColor`
onSurface, `ItemLeadingIconColor`/`ItemTrailingIconColor` onSurfaceVariant,
disabled-0.38 pair) — the values `defaultMenuItemColors` actually reads for
the plain, non-selectable `DropdownMenuItemContent` this component ports,
not the separate Expressive per-item hover/press shape-morph roles
(`ItemHoveredContainerExpressiveShape`, etc.) that belong to the
out-of-scope grouped/segmented-menu rendering path. Checked-item color
comes from `StandardMenuTokens` (`ItemSelectedContainerColor`
tertiaryContainer, `ItemSelected*Color` onTertiaryContainer, disabled-0.38
pair) — the values `defaultMenuSelectableItemColors` actually reads, not
the unread `MenuTokens.ListItemSelectedContainerColor`/secondaryContainer
role the token file itself defines but no default color resolver ever
reaches. `MenuDefaults`' own constants supply the `112`/`280px`
`DropdownMenuItemDefaultMinWidth`/`MaxWidth`, `48px` menu-specific
`MenuListItemContainerHeight`, `12px` `DropdownMenuItemHorizontalPadding`,
and `8px` `DropdownMenuVerticalPadding`/`MenuHorizontalMargin` (the latter
reused as this component's viewport clamp margin on both axes — Android's
separate 48dp `MenuVerticalMargin` clears system status/navigation bars
with no web equivalent, so it is not ported as a second value).
`MenuItemColors`' own resolution takes only `(enabled, selected)` — no
hover/focus/pressed axis exists in the source's color model — so
hover/pressed feedback reuses the shared state-layer system every other v1
interactive component already applies; `MenuTokens.FocusIndicatorColor`
(secondary) is registered anyway for a visible keyboard-focus ring, the
same accessibility-driven registration Checkbox/Radio already made for an
upstream-unread role. Label typography reuses the theme's own
`label-large` typescale role directly, the same unread-typography-role
precedent every prior task established.

`Select` registers no component tokens of its own. Its field chrome reuses
`text-field`'s registration unchanged — the pinned `ExposedDropdownMenuBox`
composes a real `TextField`/`OutlinedTextField` and reads the same
`TextFieldColors`/`TextFieldTokens` with no distinct token file of its own —
and its popup listbox reuses `menu`'s registration unchanged, since
`ExposedDropdownMenuDefaults` itself resolves straight through to
`MenuDefaults.shape`/`containerColor`/`TonalElevation`/`ShadowElevation`,
the exact same values plain `DropdownMenu` uses. This extends the T14
TextField/TextArea one-shared-domain precedent to a third and fourth public
component.

`Tooltip` registers the same AndroidX Material 3 branch revision
`225f50d42bf0adeb2abf4b6109befb5ab6ce4efc` (still the branch's current HEAD
as of this task), `PlainTooltipTokens.kt` blob
`0a3aa15fe2d33a30f06e3697013c95a2bcb5cf89` and `RichTooltipTokens.kt` blob
`b327485a280348ed12ccd70384ae1e1fb7160064`, both at `VERSION: v0_210`.
Plain container color/shape/supporting-text color come from
`PlainTooltipTokens` (`ContainerColor` inverseSurface, `ContainerShape`
cornerExtraSmall, `SupportingTextColor` inverseOnSurface). Rich container
color/shape/elevation and subhead/supporting-text color come from
`RichTooltipTokens` (`ContainerColor` surfaceContainer, `ContainerShape`
cornerMedium, `ContainerElevation` level2, `SubheadColor`/
`SupportingTextColor` onSurfaceVariant) — `ActionLabelText*`/
`ActionFocusLabelTextColor`/`ActionHoverLabelTextColor`/
`ActionPressedLabelTextColor` are not registered, since the rich-tooltip
action button has no web port (`role="tooltip"` disallows interactive
content; see ADR 0018). Sizing/spacing constants (`TooltipMinWidth`/
`MinHeight`, `plainTooltipMaxWidth`/`richTooltipMaxWidth`,
`PlainTooltipContentPadding`, `RichTooltipHorizontalPadding`,
`SpacingBetweenTooltipAndAnchor`) come straight from `Tooltip.kt` itself,
since Compose treats them as plain layout constants rather than
`@Composable` color/shape roles — the same status they keep here.
`rich-padding-block`/`rich-subhead-gap` approximate the source's
baseline-relative padding constants as ordinary CSS block padding/margin, a
documented simplification. Typography reuses the theme's own
`body-small`/`title-small`/`body-medium` typescale roles directly.

`Snackbar` registers the same pinned revision, `SnackbarTokens.kt` blob
`45acfed8dae975007c068543cc3796d6b4556d40` at `VERSION: v0_103`. Container
color/elevation/shape come from `SnackbarTokens` (`ContainerColor`
inverseSurface, `ContainerElevation` level3, `ContainerShape`
cornerExtraSmall); supporting-text/action-label/dismiss-icon color are
`SupportingTextColor` (inverseOnSurface), `ActionLabelTextColor`
(inversePrimary), and `IconColor` (inverseOnSurface) — the pinned source's
public `Snackbar` composable has no separate leading status-icon slot, so
`IconColor`/`IconSize` belong to the dismiss action only. Action/icon
focus/hover/pressed colors all resolve to the same enabled role (confirmed
against material-web's `_md-comp-snackbar.scss` at the `material-web-tokens`
source's own pinned revision `b4de401eb665ec63474f39319a4ba8f2145974cc`, the
first time this project's cross-validation source corroborates a
component-level color role rather than a missing numeric value), so
hover/press feedback reuses the shared `--m3e-sys-state-*` system via
`currentColor`, the same `Menu`/`Select` precedent. `ContainerMaxWidth`,
`HorizontalSpacing`, `HorizontalSpacingButtonSide`, and
`SnackbarVerticalPadding` come straight from `Snackbar.kt` itself, the same
plain-layout-constant status Tooltip's own sizing constants have. No
viewport-offset token is registered: the pinned source leaves screen-edge
placement to a consuming `Scaffold`, and material-web ships no snackbar
implementation to cross-validate against either, so the bottom offset is a
plain CSS value, not a claimed-sourced token — the same status Menu's own
`z-index: 1000` already has.

`Tabs` registers the same pinned revision, `PrimaryNavigationTabTokens.kt`
blob `3a7cc1b6e3dc512162a43ef08275f8afa6433a23` at `VERSION: v0_162` and
`SecondaryNavigationTabTokens.kt` blob
`a19ea9bf5a359ba8a81b67cdaac79f378b6d0749`, also `VERSION: v0_162`.
Indicator color/height/shape and the `'primary'`-only content-hugging
width come from `PrimaryNavigationTabTokens` (`ActiveIndicatorColor`
primary, `ActiveIndicatorHeight` 3dp, `ActiveIndicatorShape`
`RoundedCornerShape(3dp)`) plus the `24dp` default width parameter
`TabRowDefaults.PrimaryIndicator` itself defines (not a token-file value).
`SecondaryNavigationTabTokens` defines no indicator fields of its own — the
pinned source's own `TabRowDefaults.SecondaryIndicator` reads
`PrimaryNavigationTabTokens.ActiveIndicatorColor`/`ActiveIndicatorHeight`
directly — so `'secondary'` reuses the same `indicator-color`/
`indicator-height` pair rather than a duplicate value under a second name.
Active/inactive label and icon color come from each token file's own
`Active*Color`/`Inactive*Color` pair (`primary`/`onSurfaceVariant` for
`'primary'`; plain `onSurface`/`onSurfaceVariant` for `'secondary'` —
deliberately more subdued, not brand-colored). `divider-color`/
`divider-height` come from `SecondaryNavigationTabTokens.DividerColor`/
`DividerHeight` (surfaceVariant, 1dp), even though the pinned source's own
default `divider` composable for *both* `PrimaryTabRow`/`SecondaryTabRow`
is actually a generic, non-tab-specific `HorizontalDivider()` — this
project surfaces the actually-defined, traceable token value instead of an
untraceable system-generic one. `container-height` (48px,
`ContainerHeight`/`SmallTabHeight`) and `container-height-with-icon-and-
label` (72px, `LargeTabHeight`, the value `Tab.kt`'s own
`TabBaselineLayout` actually uses — not the token file's unread 64px
`IconAndLabelTextContainerHeight`) both come straight from `Tab.kt`/
`TabRow.kt`, the same plain-layout-constant status Tooltip's/Snackbar's own
sizing constants have; likewise `label-inline-padding` (16px,
`HorizontalTextPadding`) and the scrollable-variant `scrollable-min-tab-
width`/`scrollable-edge-padding` (90px/52px,
`ScrollableTabRowMinTabWidth`/`ScrollableTabRowEdgeStartPadding`).
`icon-label-gap` approximates the source's own baseline-relative stacked
layout as an ordinary flexbox gap, the same baseline-to-block-model
simplification already applied to Tooltip's rich-variant padding.
`disabled-label-color`/`disabled-icon-color` (both `onSurface` at `0.38`
opacity) have no source at all: `Tab`'s `enabled` param removes
interactivity only, with no distinct disabled color axis in the pinned
source's own `TabTransition` — this registers the same universal disabled
dimming every other v1 interactive component already uses. Label
typography reuses the theme's own `title-small` typescale role directly
(`LabelTextFont`, unread by name for the same reason as every prior
component's typography roles).
