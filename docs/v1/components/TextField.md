# TextField

`TextField` is a native `input` with a Material label, indicator/outline,
icon slots, and supporting/error text, in the `filled` and `outlined`
variants. It shares its label/border/icon/supporting-text decoration with
`TextArea` — the pinned source itself reuses one decoration layer for both
single- and multi-line fields.

```tsx
import { TextField } from '@language-lit/material3-expressive/v1'
import '@language-lit/material3-expressive/v1/styles.css'

<TextField
  label="Email"
  variant="outlined"
  type="email"
  value={email}
  onChange={(event) => setEmail(event.currentTarget.value)}
/>
```

## Contract

- The rendered control is one native `input`, associated with a native
  `label` through `htmlFor`/`id` (generated with `useId()` when the caller
  supplies none). Its ref, `name`, `value`/`defaultValue`, `form`,
  `required`, ARIA and data attributes, and native handlers are forwarded to
  that input.
- `className` and `style` describe the field root.
- Value state is left entirely to native controlled/uncontrolled `input`
  behavior — this component owns no derived value state, so React's own
  development warnings for conflicting `value`/`defaultValue` already apply.
- `type` accepts text-like values (`text`, `email`, `password`, `search`,
  `tel`, `url`, `number`); types with incompatible browser-owned chrome are
  excluded at the type level.
- `error` sets `aria-invalid` (unless the caller already set their own) and
  recolors the label, indicator/outline, and supporting text. It does not
  alter `supportingText` content — the caller owns the message.

## Floating label

The label floats between a large resting position/type size and a small
top-aligned position/type size, driven by the input's own native
`:focus`/`:placeholder-shown` pseudo classes rather than React-rendered
state. That means the label repositions correctly even when the value
changes outside a normal input event — browser autofill, a form reset, an
imperative ref write — the same native-truth precedent established for
Radio's checked state.

A caller-supplied `placeholder` is shown only once the label has floated
clear of the input's resting position, matching the pinned source's own
placeholder slot. When no `placeholder` is supplied, the native attribute
still resolves to a single space internally — purely so
`:placeholder-shown` keeps working — and nothing is visibly shown.

## Variants

| Variant | Container | Border affordance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `filled` (default) | surface-container-highest, top-only rounded | 1px bottom indicator, 2px focused |
| `outlined` | transparent, fully rounded | 1px border with a label-sized notch, 2px focused |

The outlined notch uses three CSS flex panels. A hidden body-small label
clone gives the middle panel its intrinsic width, and that panel's top stroke
scales away when the visible label floats. This produces a label-sized gap
without JS measurement while keeping the outline and label in the same
border-box coordinate system.

## Icons and supporting text

```tsx
<TextField
  variant="outlined"
  label="Search"
  leadingIcon={<Icon source="search" />}
  supportingText="Press enter to search"
/>
```

`leadingIcon`/`trailingIcon` render inside a 48px touch target at the
field's edges and adjust the input's own content padding. `supportingText`
renders below the field and is associated through `aria-describedby`,
composed with any caller-supplied `aria-describedby` rather than replacing
it.

## Tokens and boundaries

`TextField` and `TextArea` share one `--m3e-comp-text-field-*` registration.
Every content color role (input, placeholder, label, icons, supporting text)
is identical between the pinned source's filled and outlined token files, so
this port keeps one unprefixed copy of each rather than a duplicated pair;
only the container fill/shape and the indicator/outline border are
registered per variant.

Theme overrides remain scoped to `Material3Provider`; `TextField` injects no
runtime styles. It imports no legacy source, Next.js, Vite, router, animation
library, or private downstream application code.
