# v1 internal primitives

Private web and React primitives shared by multiple v1 features live here. This
directory is not exported from the package.

- `composeEventHandlers` preserves consumer-first event ordering and native
  `preventDefault()` cancellation.
- `useControllableState` keeps controlled values authoritative and initializes
  uncontrolled state exactly once.
- `composeRefs` assigns one node to both a consumer ref and a library-owned ref
  so components that read their own DOM node still forward the primary element.
- `TextFieldChrome` renders the label, indicator/outline, icon, and
  supporting-text decoration shared by `TextField` and `TextArea` around a
  native `input`/`textarea` child, matching the one decoration layer the
  pinned Compose source reuses for both single- and multi-line fields.
- `overlayPosition` has two pure position functions: `computeOverlayPosition`
  (start/end/clamp horizontally, below/above/clamp vertically, 8px margin),
  shared by `Menu` and `Select`'s popup, and `computeTooltipPosition`
  (center-aligned cross axis, single flip on collision, zero margin), used
  by `Tooltip`.
- `useAnchoredOverlay` owns the portal mount lifecycle, live repositioning,
  outside-click/Escape dismissal, and deferred-unmount exit animation shared
  by `Menu`, `Select`, and `Tooltip`'s popup — see ADR 0017 for why this is
  needed at all (neither component gets Dialog's native top-layer/backdrop/
  focus-restore behavior for free). Its optional `computePosition` override
  (added for `Tooltip` in T18) lets a caller replace the position algorithm
  entirely while still sharing the mount/measure/dismiss lifecycle.
